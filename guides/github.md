# GitHub Provider Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to use the GitHub provider with `PSAISuite`. Visit the official [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.16/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) to create a personal access token.

## Setup

To use the GitHub provider, you need a GitHub token with the necessary permissions to access the models API.

Set the `GithubKey` environment variable:

```powershell
$env:GithubKey = "your-github-token"
```

# Create a Chat Completion

```powershell
Install-Module PSAISuite
```

In your code:

```powershell
# Import the module
Import-Module PSAISuite
